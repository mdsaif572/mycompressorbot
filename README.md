# What's The Extra In This Repo And Why This Repoü§î
‚óè In these days [Railway](railway.app) banning many Repo on the basis of the requirements of the Repo,Railway started doing that because many people broke their terms of use they deploy illegal stuffs.

‚óè As all knows that Railway has much better speed of compressing video in compare to other free service like heroku 

‚óè That's why I edited Real Repo and make it deployable to railway again And also remove some useless Emoji because I hate emoji üòâ.
